# Africa's Transition into a Low-Carbon Future: Evidence on the Nexus Between Environmental Tax, Foreign Direct Investment, Resource Dependence, and Technological Progress

## Summary

This study explores the impact of climate change on sustainable economic growth and environmental sustainability in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It investigates how environmental taxation, foreign direct investment (FDI), natural resource rent, and technological innovation contribute to achieving a low-carbon future. Using data from 1995 to 2019 and advanced econometric techniques (Cross-Sectional Augmented Autoregressive Distributed Lag and Method of Moments Quantile Regression), the findings suggest that environmental taxes effectively reduce carbon emissions. While FDI initially increases emissions in the short term, it leads to a significant reduction over time. Natural resource rent exacerbates environmental degradation, while technological innovation contributes to long-term emission reductions. The study confirms that environmental taxation consistently lowers CO₂ emissions across all quantiles. Based on these findings, the study recommends that policymakers implement stricter carbon tax policies, establish sub-regional carbon offset markets, and prioritize investments in clean energy infrastructure to support long-term sustainability.

## Introduction

With the global emphasis on balancing economic growth and sustainability in light of climate change, Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) holds significant potential to transition to a low-carbon economy. This opportunity arises from its abundant renewable resources and green technologies. However, achieving this transition requires a multi-faceted approach involving environmental taxes, foreign investments, resource management, and technological advancements.

This study aims to assess the feasibility of a leapfrog approach for decarbonization in SSA, exploring the interplay of environmental tax, foreign investment, natural resource rents, and technology. The study addresses the following key questions:

- Can Sub-Saharan African countries leverage environmental taxes, foreign investment, and technological advancements to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels?
- What trade-offs must SSA countries consider in their efforts to transition to low-carbon economies?
- What policy mechanisms and investment strategies are necessary to facilitate this transition?

## Problem Statement

Foreign direct investment (FDI) plays a vital role in economic development but may also contribute to environmental degradation. While FDI focused on decarbonization goals can provide financing and technological expertise, ensuring its positive impact requires careful planning and policy frameworks. Environmental taxes and technological improvements are essential tools for reducing emissions and fostering green technologies. Current literature on decarbonization in SSA tends to focus on individual factors such as environmental regulations, FDI potential, resource dependence, and technological innovations but lacks a comprehensive understanding of their interdependencies and collective impact on sustainable development.

## Aim of the Project

This study aims to offer new insights into the transition to a low-carbon future for Sub-Saharan Africa. It underscores the need to balance economic prosperity with environmental sustainability. The study advocates for a coordinated approach to evaluate the feasibility of a leapfrog approach for decarbonization in the region.

## Methodology

The study analyzes the relationships between environmental taxes, foreign direct investment (FDI), natural resource rent, and technological innovation in SSA, using data spanning from 1995 to 2019. The data was collected from reputable sources such as the World Bank, OECD, and OWID. The analysis examines the impact of these factors on CO₂ emissions, emphasizing the role of environmental regulations in promoting green foreign direct investments and assessing the influence of environmental taxes on fostering sustainable practices in resource extraction. Data quality was ensured through cleaning and outlier correction. Advanced techniques such as Westerlund’s (2007) co-integration test, Cross-Section Dependence (CSD) slope heterogeneity test, Cross-Sectional Augmented Autoregressive Distributed Lag (CS-ARDL), and Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR) were employed for data analysis, providing robust findings and generalizable results.

## Modelling

The study models carbon emissions as a function of environmental indicators using the following equation:

\[
CO2 = f(ET, FDI, NRR, T)
\]

This equation is expanded to include a constant term, coefficients, and an error term:

\[
〖CO2〗_it= β_1+ 〖β_2 ET〗_it+ 〖β_3 FDI〗_it+〖β_4 NRR〗_it+ 〖β_5 T〗_it+ ε_it …………… (2)}
\]

The model examines the interplay of environmental taxes, natural resource rents, FDI, and technology on CO₂ emissions in Sub-Saharan Africa across countries and time periods.

## Recommendations

The study recommends the following strategies to support the transition to a low-carbon future in Sub-Saharan Africa:

- Implement carbon tax policies to reduce emissions and incentivize green technologies.
- Allocate government revenue from carbon taxes to the development of clean energy infrastructure.
- Establish a regional carbon offset market to facilitate emissions reduction across countries.
- Encourage foreign direct investment (FDI) that aligns with decarbonization goals, despite its short-term impact on emissions, as long-term reductions are anticipated.
- Prioritize sustainable energy infrastructure development through public-private partnerships and tax incentives for clean energy projects.
